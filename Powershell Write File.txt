Assignment

We have a folder in which lot of files are there. For each of the employee in the company there is a file like below

 

Name_employeeID_Date-of-joining.{employee_type}

 Vijay_123123_2011-09-09.emp

Sneha_1221023_2011-09-09.contractor

 

You can get information like name, employee ID and date of joining and employee type from it.

 

Please help your HR team by making a report of employees who are eligible for special increment(raise/hike):

condition 1: Are employees and not contractors of the organization(confirm by file extension)

condition 2: Serving the organization from at least 5 years.
