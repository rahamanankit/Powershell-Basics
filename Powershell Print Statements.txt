Write-Host "This is a message"

To customise the colors of the output

Write-Host "This is a message" -ForegroundColor Red -BackgroundColor Yellow
To print variable value

$var = 1000
Write-Host "variable is $var" -ForegroundColor Red -BackgroundColor Yellow

To write output directly to a file

Write-Output "Hello I am from powershell world" >> filename.txt

$varname = Write-Output "Hello i am write output"

So Write-Output can only be stored in a variable but not Write-Host
However Write-Host provides the background color and foreground color features.
