$variable_name = "Hi I Am a string"
$variable_name
$variable_name = 1000

Another way of creating variable

New-Variable -name "variable_name" "Value of the variable"
$variable_name

To see all functions associated with this variable

$variable_name | Get-Member

To see the data type of the variable

$variable_name.GetType()

To declare constants

Set-Variable test_variable -option ReadOnly -value 1000 - This set the variable test_variable as a constant with a value of 1000 which cannot be change anymore.
Set_Variable test_variable1 -option Constant -value 2000 - This also does the same thing
'
But the difference between both is:

When a variable is ReadOnly, the variable can be removed. This does, however, require the use of the -Force parameter. Consider that a safety net. The difference here, is that when a variable is a Constant, it cannot be removed, even with the use of the -Force parameter.
